This repository simulates a penalty shootout using replicator dynamics from Game theory. It also uses Lyapunov stabilization theory and a nonlinear feedback control technique to force the agents to learn the optimal strategies. 
- se762_code.txt: has the code for the system and provides visualization for the replicator dynamics and the results of the feedback linearization
- final_report_762_report_adil_05032025.pdf: This is the white paper for the project and explains the concepts implemented in the project. 

To-do list:
- [ ] Implement policy gradient algorithm on the existing system
- [ ] Examine how the Lyapunov theory lines up with the RL policy
