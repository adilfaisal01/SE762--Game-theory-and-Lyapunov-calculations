This repository simulates a penalty shootout using replicator dynamics from Game theory and uses Lyapunov stabilization theory and nonlinear feedback control technique to force the agents to learn the optimal strategies. 
se762_code.txt: has the code for the system and provides visualization for the replicator dynamics and the results of the feedback linearization
final_report_762_report_adil_05032025.pdf: This is the white paper for the project and explains the concepts implemented in the paper. 

To-do list:
[] Implement policy gradient algorithm on the existing system
[] examine how the Lyapunov theory lines up with the RL policy
